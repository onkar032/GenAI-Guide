There are several companies and research labs working on concepts similar to the Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), particularly in areas like AutoML (Automated Machine Learning), AI-generating algorithms (AI-GAs), and reinforcement learning (RL). While the specifics of ADAS proposed in the paper are quite novel, many organizations are exploring adjacent concepts. Here are a few notable companies and initiatives:

1. Google DeepMind
AlphaFold & AlphaGo: DeepMind has been a pioneer in using AI to solve complex problems autonomously, such as protein folding (AlphaFold) and playing games like Go (AlphaGo). They employ reinforcement learning and neural architecture search techniques similar to the automated agent design discussed in ADAS.
MuZero: Another DeepMind model, MuZero, learns both to plan and play complex games without being explicitly told the rules—showing similarities to autonomous agent design in decision-making tasks.
2. OpenAI
GPT and Codex: OpenAI has been at the forefront of creating foundation models like GPT and Codex, which are used for various agentic tasks. These models are proficient at generating code and could, in theory, be used to implement something akin to ADAS, where agents autonomously improve their abilities through code generation.
AutoML-like Initiatives: OpenAI’s Codex, an AI that writes code, has been used in different ways to enable automation in software development, hinting at how a meta-agent could be programmed to create other agents autonomously.
3. Amazon Web Services (AWS) – SageMaker Autopilot
AWS's SageMaker Autopilot is an AutoML service that automatically builds, trains, and tunes machine learning models. Although this focuses more on model training rather than agentic system design, the underlying principles of automation and optimization are quite similar to ADAS’s vision of automating agent development.
4. Meta (Facebook AI Research)
Meta’s AI team has worked on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and other AutoML technologies that aim to automate the design of neural network architectures. In their open-source approach, they also focus on optimizing the components of AI systems, which aligns with the goals of ADAS to automate agentic system design.
MetaGPT: Meta recently developed MetaGPT, a multi-agent framework where agents collaborate on complex tasks. This is close to ADAS in that it tries to automate collaborative agent development, including role assignments and task planning.
5. Microsoft Research – Project Bonsai
Microsoft has developed Project Bonsai, which enables industrial systems to autonomously learn and improve decision-making using reinforcement learning. This concept aligns with ADAS's vision of agents progressively learning and adapting to new challenges automatically.
6. Uber AI Labs
POET (Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer): Uber developed POET, an AI system that creates environments and then learns how to navigate them, progressively building more complex agents. This is another example of an automated system designing agents that improve over time, similar to ADAS’s principles.
7. NVIDIA
NVIDIA Clara Discovery: NVIDIA’s Clara platform for drug discovery uses AI to automate various stages of scientific discovery, from hypothesis generation to testing and optimization. This automation in the scientific domain echoes the goal of ADAS, which aims to automate agentic system design across domains.
These companies are pioneering concepts that overlap with the goals of ADAS, particularly in automating the design of intelligent systems. Although none have explicitly implemented ADAS as outlined in the paper, the progress in AutoML, meta-learning, and multi-agent systems shows that the industry is moving in a direction where such technologies could soon become a reality.
