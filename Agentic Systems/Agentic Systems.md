# Understanding Agentic Systems: Evolution and Advancements

## What Are Agentic Systems?
Agentic systems are AI-driven systems designed to perform tasks autonomously. They involve multiple components that interact dynamically to solve complex problems through reasoning, decision-making, planning, and learning from experience. These systems are not monolithic, static programs but are instead capable of flexible, adaptive behaviors that enable them to tackle complex real-world scenarios.

Agentic systems often rely on Foundation Models (FMs), which are large-scale pre-trained AI models capable of performing a wide range of tasks. These models serve as the backbone for agentic systems, enabling them to integrate tools, reason across multiple steps, use memory, and even make decisions autonomously by accessing external resources such as databases or search engines. Examples of agentic behaviors include:

### Planning and Reasoning: Agentic systems can break down tasks into smaller sub-tasks and solve them step-by-step using reasoning capabilities.
Tool Usage: These systems can interact with tools, such as search engines or databases, to gather and process information as part of their decision-making process.
Self-Reflection and Learning: They can reflect on their actions, learn from past mistakes, and iteratively improve their performance.
Evolution of Agentic Systems
Agentic systems have evolved significantly over the last few decades, transitioning from simple rule-based programs to complex, learning-based systems:

**Rule-Based Systems (Early AI):** In the initial stages of AI, agentic systems were rule-based and could only handle specific, predefined tasks. These systems were limited in flexibility as they required hand-crafted rules and could not adapt to new environments or tasks without human intervention.

**Expert Systems (1980s-1990s):** Expert systems marked the first significant evolution, where AI could mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in specific domains. They used a combination of rules and knowledge bases to solve tasks but were still static and domain-specific.

**Reinforcement Learning (RL) (2000s):** The introduction of reinforcement learning brought a paradigm shift by enabling agentic systems to learn from their environment. RL allowed systems to make decisions based on rewards and penalties, making them adaptive to a wider range of tasks.

**Deep Learning and Foundation Models (2010s-2020s):** The rise of deep learning and large-scale foundation models like GPT and BERT allowed agentic systems to handle complex, language-based tasks. These systems could understand, generate, and reason with text, improving their flexibility and generality.
Systems such as self-driving cars and robotic assistants became more practical, combining various sensory inputs and decision-making abilities to operate autonomously in the real world.

**Multi-Agent Systems and AI Generating Algorithms (Late 2020s):** Multi-agent systems, where multiple agents work together or compete to solve tasks, became a focal point of research. AI-generating algorithms (AI-GAs), which learn to design AI systems autonomously, began to push the boundaries of agentic systems by exploring the automated creation and optimization of these agents.

Today, many agentic systems can operate across different domains, making them adaptable, self-learning, and capable of working with other agents or humans to solve tasks.
